            Leher was an experimental short film project developed as part of a collaborative module exploring the concept of Rasa (emotional essence) through visual storytelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project required students to interpret one or more Rasas and translate them into a short audio-visual experience using creative mediums such as animation, live action footage, and experimental techniques.

          <p>
            The creative objective of Leher was to explore how visual rhythm, texture, and motion can represent emotional transitions without relying on a traditional storyline.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team aimed to depict the movement between fear and calmness, treating emotion as something fluid and cyclical rather than fixed. Inspired by ocean waves, the film reflects how emotional states rise and fall, much like the movement of water.
